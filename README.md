# FENS2022_abstracts
Searchable abstracts for the FENS2022 meeting

This file has been modified from the FENS 2022 original e-book of abstracts to enable easier searching of the abstracts based on keywords and author names.

Specifically:

1. All the integrated PubMed references and abstracts have been removed.
This enables the search by keyword and author names, which was impossible in the original file since it included titles, authors, and abstracts of thousands of papers.

2. Each abstract has been placed on a single individual page.
This enables the easy bookmarking of relevant pages in the pdf reader.

3. Date and time of each poster session have been added to each abstract.

4. All other lists etc. have been removed.

Note: The first time you search in the pdf file, it takes some time to index this very long pdf, but then it is really fast for any subsequent search, as long as you donâ€™t close the file.

Enjoy the FENS meeting!
